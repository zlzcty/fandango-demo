    "\n",
    "1. It performs instrumentation to collect runtime coverage data for feedback-guided fuzzing.\n",
    "2. It generates syntactically valid and constraint-aware inputs based on a input specification including grammar rules and Python constraints.\n",
    "3. It randomly mutates input sequences\n",
    "4. It is designed specifically for network protocol fuzzing and packet mutation."

    "#### **Why do we use grammars to describe network protocols in Fandango instead of sending random bytes directly?**\n",
    "1. Because grammars preserve the protocolâ€™s structure and valid message order, allowing fuzzing to explore meaningful variations without breaking basic syntax.\n",
    "2. Because grammars make the fuzzing process slower but more secure.\n",
    "3. Because grammars completely prevent all network errors and crashes.\n",
    "4. Because grammars allow us to bypass protocol authentication steps automatically."
